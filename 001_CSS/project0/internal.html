    <h1>Welcome To Internal CSS</h1>
    <p>
      My life is like a Christopher Nolan movie I dont really understand what’s
      going on but I’m too deep into it to walk out every day feels like a
      complex subplot with timelines running in reverse forward and sideways all
      at once sometimes I wake up thinking I’m in Inception wondering if I’m in
      a dream within a dream or just really in need of coffee my plans look a
      lot like Tenet I know where I’m supposed to end up but the steps to get
      there seem to happen in reverse order conversations feel like Memento I
      remember the big moments but the details keep slipping away so I write
      mental sticky notes for my brain to find later relationships that’s
      Interstellar sometimes it’s all about love sometimes it’s all about
      distance and sometimes it’s just a black hole sucking up all my free time
      career feels like The Prestige I’m working hard on the trick but I’m still
      waiting for the big reveal where everyone claps and like any Nolan
      protagonist I spend a suspicious amount of time staring dramatically into
      the distance trying to look deep while actually wondering what’s for
      dinner but here’s the thing even if I don’t fully get the plot yet I’m
      still part of something big mysterious and kind of beautiful maybe one day
      it’ll all make sense or maybe it won’t and that’s okay because the
      soundtrack is epic the shots are cinematic and I’m just enjoying the ride
